## Password Generator Homework Assignment 3:

Tasked with writing the JavaScript for a random password generator. Users are able to specify the length of the password, and whether or not they would like lower case letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.

In short, I ask the user which types of characters they want the password to consist of and use those boolean values to create a custom array filled with only their desired character types. A for loop is used to iterate through the custom array and attach random index values to a password that is their desired length.
